Code for a possible paper on absolute extinctions
=================================================

Use GAIA data to measure absolute extinctions using
the pair method.
Turn out accuracy in DR2 is not good enough - uncertainties
on the absolute extinctions are ~0.2 to 1.0 mag.
Need accuracies to be comparable to the extrapolated method that gets
something like 0.01-0.03 mag.
And there are clear luminosity mismatches between the reddened and
comparision stars.

GAIA DR2 distances might be useful for measuring extinction with models.
